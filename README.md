this is a simple food delivery project. The project has admin panel and user panel. 
Admin has the permision to add or edit restaurants and foods. Note that admin password is "123" by default and you are able to change it from DataBase.java . 
Users have to sign up first and then they can see the restaurants and foods and order whatever they want.
